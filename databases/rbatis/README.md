The `rbatis` ORM developers keep their own example on usage with Actix Web.

You can find the example in the [rbatis/example/src/actix_web](https://github.com/rbatis/rbatis/blob/master/example/src/actix_web/main.rs) directory.

See the [`example` folder readme](https://github.com/rbatis/rbatis/tree/master/example) for a guide on how to get started with the example.
